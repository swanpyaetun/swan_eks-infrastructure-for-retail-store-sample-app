## 1. AWS

### 1.1. Route 53 domain and public hosted zone

A domain called "swanpyaetun.com" must be present in Route 53 Registered domains. A public hosted zone called "swanpyaetun.com" must be present in Route 53 Hosted zones.

### 1.2. Create AWS resources required for swanpyaetun/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app Project, and swanpyaetun/retail-store-sample-app Project

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/
git clone git@github.com:swanpyaetun/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app.git
```
Go to ~/Desktop/ and clone the [https://github.com/swanpyaetun/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app](https://github.com/swanpyaetun/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app) repository.
<br><br>

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app/swan_terraform/swan_environments/swan_prerequisites/
```
Go to ~/Desktop/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app/swan_terraform/swan_environments/swan_prerequisites/ directory.
<br><br>

```hcl
# terraform {
#   backend "s3" {
#     region       = "ap-southeast-1"
#     bucket       = "swan-terraform-backend-655355946217-ap-southeast-1-an"
#     key          = "swan_prerequisites/terraform.tfstate"
#     use_lockfile = true # s3 state locking
#   }
# }
```
Comment out backend.tf file, since S3 bucket has not been created yet.
<br><br>

```bash
terraform init
```
Run this command.
<br><br>

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=prerequisites.tfvars
```
Run this command to create AWS resources required for swanpyaetun/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app project, and swanpyaetun/retail-store-sample-app project.<br>
S3 bucket and CI IAM role are created for swanpyaetun/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app project.<br>
CI IAM role, private ECR repositories, and ACM certificate are created for swanpyaetun/retail-store-sample-app project.
<br><br>

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    region       = "ap-southeast-1"
    bucket       = "swan-terraform-backend-655355946217-ap-southeast-1-an"
    key          = "swan_prerequisites/terraform.tfstate"
    use_lockfile = true # s3 state locking
  }
}
```
Uncomment backend.tf file, since S3 bucket has already been created.
<br><br>

```bash
terraform init -migrate-state
```
Run this command to migrate "local" backend to "s3" backend. Enter "yes".
<br><br>

```bash
rm -rf .terraform/ .terraform.lock.hcl terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup
```
You can clean up the directory.

## 2. GitHub Actions

### 2.1. Create repository secret

```bash
aws iam get-role --role-name swan_githubactions_terraform_iam_role --query 'Role.Arn' --output text
```
Run this command to get "swan_githubactions_terraform_iam_role" arn.

In swanpyaetun/swan_eks-infrastructure-for-retail-store-sample-app repository, go to "Settings" -> Security and quality -> Secrets and variables -> Actions.<br>
Create a new repository secret:<br>
Name: SWAN_CI_IAM_ROLE_ARN<br>
Secret: "swan_githubactions_terraform_iam_role" arn
